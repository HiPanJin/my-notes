description: Kicking off my iOS development and SEO learning journey and sharing progress and roadblocks on this blog.
---

I am officially starting two tracks at once: iOS development and SEO. I want to keep this blog as my public notebook, so I will drop quick updates, small wins, and the rough spots I run into.

What to expect here:

- Short progress notes on what I built or broke in Swift/SwiftUI.
- SEO experiments and what actually moves the needle.
- Problems I get stuck on and how I eventually solve them.

If you see a gap between posts, feel free to nudge me—I want this to stay honest and consistent. Let's see how far this goes.
