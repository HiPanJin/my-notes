Hi, I’m Jin Pan. I’m learning in public and using this blog as my notebook.

Current focus:

- iOS: Swift, SwiftUI, and the day-to-day of building apps.
- SEO: experiments, what actually moves rankings, and what doesn’t.

I’ll post short progress notes, problems I run into, and how I fix them. If you want to reach out, email me at [i@panjin.me](mailto:i@panjin.me) or say hi on [X](https://x.com/Jindevweb).
